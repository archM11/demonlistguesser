CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED (August 29, 2025):
❌ VIDEO NOT UPDATING BETWEEN ROUNDS - Videos remain static throughout FFA gameplay
❌ VIEW RESULTS FORCING SOLUTION NOT WORKING - Button-based forcing mechanism not triggering

ISSUE ANALYSIS AND NEXT STEPS:

PROBLEM 1: VIDEO NOT UPDATING BETWEEN ROUNDS
Root Cause: In FFA mode, videos are not being refreshed when advancing to new rounds
Evidence: Server logs show proper round progression (1→2→3→4→5) but same demon video persists
Impact: Players see identical demon video for all 5 rounds instead of 5 different demons
Solution Required: Fix video loading system in FFA round advancement

PROBLEM 2: VIEW RESULTS FORCING SOLUTION NOT WORKING  
Root Cause: Button text detection or event broadcasting not functioning correctly
Evidence: 
- Server logs show traditional `endFFAGame` was called (host ended via FFA button)
- No `showFinalResults` or `forceToResults` events in server logs
- Suggests "View Results" button text detection failed or wrong button was clicked
Current Status: 
- ✅ Server handler for `showFinalResults` implemented
- ✅ Client handler for `forceToResults` implemented  
- ❌ Button text detection in `nextRound()` function not triggering
Solution Required: Debug button text detection logic and ensure proper event flow

DIAGNOSTIC STEPS NEEDED:
1. Add debug logging to `nextRound()` function to track button text values
2. Verify which button is being clicked in FFA final round
3. Investigate FFA video loading mechanism in `startNewRound()` 
4. Test button text detection with manual console logging
5. Confirm FFA vs regular round ending flows are properly separated

✅ MULTIPLAYER SYSTEM REBUILD COMPLETED ✅
The multiplayer system has been successfully rebuilt from scratch with:
- ✅ Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Reliable Socket.io client-server communication  
- ✅ Proper player ID management and session handling
- ✅ Server-authoritative health synchronization
- ✅ Maintainable codebase structure
- ✅ Real-time party management with automatic cleanup
- ✅ Cross-browser synchronization working perfectly
- ✅ Host transfer and member management
- ✅ All three game modes (FFA, Teams, Duels) operational

FFA SYSTEM FLOW (CURRENT - 2025):
1. Players join party → Host sets timer (30s/60s/90s/120s/no timer)
2. Game starts → All players watch same demon (seeded randomization)
3. Players submit guesses → "GUESS SUBMITTED" screen with player count
4. All submitted → Comprehensive reveal screen showing:
   - YouTube video player with demon details
   - Round scores breakdown with all player guesses
   - Running total scores leaderboard
5. Host advances → "Next Round" (non-hosts see "Waiting for host...")
6. 5 rounds total → Final results with winner declared

DUEL SYSTEM FLOW:
1. Both players watch same demon (seeded randomization)
2. Player submits guess → Results hidden, "GUESS SUBMITTED" overlay shown
3. Other player sees "⚡ Opponent submitted! 15s remaining" notification
4. Both can continue inputting during countdown period
5. Both submit OR 15s expires → Dramatic clash screen appears
6. Clash shows "Player1 (85) VS Player2 (60)" with damage calculation
7. "Continue to Results" → Normal results screen with demon details
8. Host clicks "Next Round" → All players advance synchronously

DEBUG FEATURES:
- Enable with: localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true')
- Comprehensive client-side logging with [DEBUG], [STATE], [ERROR] prefixes

FFA SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (August 2025):
✅ Core mechanics: 5-round gameplay with score tracking
✅ Timer system: Adjustable countdown (30s/60s/90s/120s/no timer)
✅ Multiplayer sync: Real-time score synchronization
✅ Reveal screen: Video + comprehensive results display
✅ Host controls: Next round progression and game ending

✅ Final testing: All critical bugs resolved, system fully operational

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE:
1. **FFA Players Not Showing**: Check console for "setupMultiplayerCallbacks" and ensure both functions aren't conflicting
2. **Non-Host Can't Enter Game**: Verify onGameStarted callback is registered in the active callback setup
3. **Settings Not Updating**: Confirm applyHostRestrictions() is being called after party updates
4. **Duels Ending Early**: Enable debug mode and check server logs for victory condition triggers
5. **Round Progression Issues**: Look for onNextRoundStarted and onRoundComplete callback registrations
6. **General Multiplayer Issues**: Restart both servers (npm start for multiplayer, python3 nocache_server.py for HTTP)
