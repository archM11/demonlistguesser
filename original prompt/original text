Geometry dash demon list guesser.
We are going to be building a web based game that shows users only the YouTube video about a demon on the geometry dash demon list, (including all of the main, extended, and legacy list), and the user will guess what placement the demon is on the list. (so the id, eg. ID 120 would be the 120th hardest demon. (This game will function like geoguessr but for the geometry dash demon list instead) By ID I want you to find the pointer crate ID) After the user guesses, the answer will be revealed and the true id, the level name, and the verifier and creator will show. Basically all the level info will be shown. The point of the app is that the user will have to analyze the video with no other information and has to try and guess the difficulty. I want you to make a layout for this how you see fit and then if I donâ€™t like it I will ask for changes.
I need you to get from pointer crate an updated list of the demon list so, demon names, verifiers, creators, demon id, YouTube links.
There should be an option to play only the main list, extended list, or legacy list, or all lists. This should be able to be played solo and multiplayer in duels. The game should give you points for getting the exact placement and taper off the amount you get based off how far you were. 
I want you to make suggestions that would make it have similar features to geoguessr that are missing here to clarify the vision and on my word you start production.
