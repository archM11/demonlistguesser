# DemonList Guessr - Project Status & Issues

## 🎮 Project Overview
A multiplayer Geometry Dash Demon List guessing game with duel system, where players guess demon placements and battle with health-based combat.

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES - CURRENTLY BROKEN

### 1. **MAJOR: Client Code Cache Issue - Debug Logs Not Loading**
**Status:** BLOCKING ALL OTHER FIXES  
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Symptoms:**
- Added extensive debug logging to game.js but logs don't appear in browser console
- Browser is serving cached version of JavaScript despite file changes
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5/Cmd+Shift+R) not working
- Added console.log at top of file with timestamp - still not showing

**Impact:** Cannot debug any other issues because debug code isn't loading

**Attempted Fixes:**
- ✅ Added cache-busting console.log at top of file
- ✅ Added version numbers to debug messages  
- ❌ Hard refresh not working
- ❌ Client still loading old JavaScript

**NEEDS:** Force browser cache clear or serve file from different location

### 2. **CRITICAL: Double Damage Bug - Non-Host Takes 2x Damage**
**Status:** GAME BREAKING  
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Symptoms:**
- Non-host player takes DOUBLE the damage they should
- Host shows correct damage (e.g. 50 HP damage)
- Non-host shows double damage (e.g. 100 HP damage) and dies instantly
- Causes health desynchronization between players

**Server Logs Show Correct Calculation:**
```
⚔️ SERVER: Player 1 Score: 100 Player 2 Score: 50
💥 SERVER: Player 1 wins round - damaged Player 2 for 50 HP
🏥 SERVER: Updated health: { player1: 100, player2: 50 }
```

**But Client Shows:**
- Host: 50 damage (correct)
- Non-host: 100 damage (WRONG - doubled!)

### 3. **CRITICAL: Health Values Completely Inverted**
**Status:** GAME BREAKING  
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Symptoms:**
- Each player sees WRONG health values for themselves vs opponent
- Server: Player1=87HP, Player2=0HP
- Host sees: You=87HP, Opponent=0HP (correct)
- Non-host sees: You=0HP, Opponent=87HP (WRONG - inverted!)

**Root Cause:** Player ID mapping logic is broken - each client shows other player's health as their own

### 4. **JavaScript Errors Breaking Game Flow**
**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED
**Evidence:** 
```
Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: youWon is not defined at game.js:3571
```
**Fix Applied:** ✅ Added proper variable declarations for `youWon` and `opponentWon`

### 5. **Results Screen Not Working**
**Status:** IMPROVED BUT UNVERIFIED
**Symptoms:**
- Players get stuck in game view after clicking "View Results"
- Only host reaches summary screen
- Non-host never sees final results

**Fix Applied:** ✅ Added proper winner detection and screen transition logic

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Data Flow (Current Issue)
```
submitGuess() → submitDuelScore() → multiplayerManager.submitScore() → server
```

**Expected data format:**
```javascript
{ score: 99, guess: 15 }
```

**Problem:** Guess data is being lost somewhere in this pipeline.

### Key Files & Functions

#### `/game.js`
- `submitGuess(timeout = false)` - Entry point for guess submission
- `submitDuelScore(playerData)` - Handles duel-specific score/guess submission
- `triggerDuelClash()` - Manages duel combat and animations
- `showDetailedDuelResults()` - Displays health bars and opponent guesses

#### `/multiplayer.js`
- `submitScore(data)` - Client-side multiplayer communication
- Handles both old format (just score) and new format (score + guess)

#### `/server.js`
- `submitScore` event handler - Server-side data processing
- Should receive and store both scores and guesses

### Health System
```javascript
duelHealth: {
  [player1Id]: 100, // Player 1: 100 HP
  [player2Id]: 100  // Player 2: 100 HP  
}
```

## 🐛 Debug System Status

### Implemented Debugging
1. **Data Transmission Logs:**
   - `🎯 DUEL: Sending to multiplayer manager:` - Shows data being sent
   - `📤 CLIENT: Submitting score data:` - Shows data at socket level
   - `📋 SERVER: Raw data received:` - Shows what server receives

2. **Health Calculation Logs:**
   - `🏥 HEALTH DEBUG:` - User IDs, health objects, calculations

3. **Guess Tracking Logs:**
   - `🎯 GUESS DEBUG:` - Duel state, pending results, guess resolution

4. **Overlay Management:**
   - `🧹 AGGRESSIVE CLEANUP:` - Overlay removal status

### How to Use Debug System
1. Open browser console
2. Start a duel game
3. Submit a guess
4. Look for debug logs with emojis (🎯, 📤, 📋, 🏥, etc.)
5. Compare expected vs actual data at each step

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

### Priority 1: Fix Browser Cache Issue
**CRITICAL:** Must resolve cache issue before any other fixes can be tested or verified.

**Options to try:**
1. **Clear all browser data** for localhost:3002
2. **Open in incognito/private window**
3. **Add query parameter** to JavaScript file URL (`game.js?v=123`)
4. **Rename the file** temporarily (`game_v2.js`) and update HTML
5. **Use different browser** for testing

### Priority 2: Fix Double Damage Server-Side
**SERVER-FIRST APPROACH:** Since client cache is broken, fix the core issue on the server side.

The server damage calculation is correct, but the client is applying damage twice:
1. Once from server health update
2. Once from local client calculation  

**Need to ensure:**
- Server sends authoritative health values
- Client NEVER calculates damage locally when server data exists
- Health updates are properly synchronized

### Priority 3: Fix Health Display Logic
**Player ID mapping is broken** - each client is showing the wrong player's health.

**Root issue:** 
- `getCurrentUserId()` might be returning wrong value
- Or health display logic is swapping player1/player2 values

## 🔧 Defensive Programming Fixes Applied

- ✅ Added clash prevention to stop double-execution
- ✅ Added health bounds checking (don't damage if already 0 HP)  
- ✅ Added server health priority flags
- ✅ Fixed undefined variable errors (`youWon`, `opponentWon`)
- ✅ Added extensive logging (not visible due to cache issue)

## 📝 Current Blockers

1. **Cache Issue:** Can't test any client-side fixes
2. **Double Damage:** Game unplayable due to health desync
3. **Health Inversion:** Players see wrong health values
4. **Limited Debugging:** Server logs only - no client debug info

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **URGENT:** Resolve cache issue by clearing browser data completely
2. **Test if cache-busting console.log appears** at top of game.js
3. **Once debug logs work:** Identify exact cause of double damage
4. **Fix player ID mapping** in health display logic
5. **Verify server-client health synchronization** works properly
